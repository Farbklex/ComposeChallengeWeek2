## :scroll: Description
This is a countdown timer sample app which utilizes jetpack compose. It was created as part of the
[#AndroidDevChallenge](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/02/android-dev-challenge-lift-off-with.html).
The app showcases the usage of state handling and the data flow between a `ViewModel`, `Activity` and composables.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Common timer apps let us put in any arbitrary time. This is too complex!

We know what you need: The *essentials*. Focus on what is important and only stop the time required to
create the perfect üçµ, üçú or a medium cooked, medium sized ü•ö.
